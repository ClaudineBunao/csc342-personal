## 1. An interesting challenge you encountered when implementing Howler. What was the issue, and how did you solve it?
I couldn't figure out how to load the posts of my current user because I wasn't storing it properly. I solved this by using the right path.

## 2. What additional feature would you add to Howler, and how would you suggest it should be implemented?
I would add liking a post with setting a boolean and tracking the number of total likes by incrementing a variable's value.
