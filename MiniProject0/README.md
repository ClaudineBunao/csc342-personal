## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I really appreciate and admire the Ungrading process. It encourages students to keep trying to do better and learn more with less stress about doing enough to get a specific grade.<br>

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I think the Ungrading process for this class is reasonable. This way the students will hold themselves accountable throughout the school year.<br>

## 3. On a scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?

My confidence level that I can get an A is at a 4 because I know I am a hard worker who is very detail oriented and passionate, however I worry about my time management skills.<br>
